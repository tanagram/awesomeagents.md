# Awesome Agents Best Practices Collection

A curated collection of best practices for the most popular programming libraries and frameworks worldwide, compiled from GitHub repositories' AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and .cursor/rules documentation.

3. **Reference during code reviews** to ensure standards are met
4. **Share with your team** to establish coding standards

### For AI Coding Assistants
TK

### For Teams
- Use as a starting point for your team's coding standards

- Reference during onboarding to quickly bring new developers up to speed

## Contributing

This collection was generated by analyzing:
- GitHub repositories with AGENTS.md files
- CLAUDE.md coding guidelines
- .cursor/rules configurations
- Official framework documentation
- Production codebases

Use some version of this prompt as a starting point for generating content:

```
for each library, find mentions of it in files named AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` directories in a public github search like this: https://github.com/search?q=path%3A%22AGENTS.md%22&type=code

our goal is to create a collection of markdown files in this directory, one for each library (each file should be named after the library). each markdown file should include at least ten bullet points describing best practices for using that library, using the github search examples as a reference. grab the best content from those examples and put them in our files. prefer content that sound like instructions about how to write code (e.g. contain the words "should", "have to", "must") instead of instructions about how to call tools or subjective, low-impact code style stuff.

look at the existing MD files in this directory for output structure. in particular:
* prefer direct output starting with a verb, like "use X" instead of "you should use X"
* avoid subjective instructions like "do y properly" because it's impossible to objectively evaluate what "properly" means by just looking at the source code (remember, these instructions will be evaluated by AI that doesn't have much context on the overall codebase).
* output one instruction per line, no bolding, no extra newlines between entries.
```

## Key Principles

All best practices in this collection follow these principles:

- **Prescriptive** - Clear guidance on what to do and what to avoid
- **Actionable** - Specific enough to implement immediately
- **Security-focused** - Emphasize secure coding practices
- **Performance-aware** - Consider performance implications
- **Maintainable** - Promote code that's easy to understand and modify

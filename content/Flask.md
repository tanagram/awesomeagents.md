- Implement proper logging using Flask's app.logger or Python's logging module.
- Use Flask-CORS for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing when building APIs.
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints using Flask-Limiter.
- Use request validation and sanitization for all user inputs.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Use g object for storing request-specific data.
- Implement database connection pooling for production environments.

# JUnit Best Practices

- Use JUnit 5 (JUnit Jupiter) for new projects instead of JUnit 4.
- Use `@Test` annotation to mark test methods and ensure they are public or package-private.
- Use descriptive test method names that clearly indicate what is being tested.
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for structuring test methods.
- Use `@BeforeEach` for setup code that runs before each test method.
- Use `@AfterEach` for cleanup code that runs after each test method.
- Use `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` for expensive setup/teardown that can be shared across all tests.
- Use `@DisplayName` to provide readable test descriptions in test reports.
- Use `@ParameterizedTest` with value sources to run the same test with multiple inputs.
- Use `@Nested` to group related tests and create hierarchical test structures.
- Use assertions from `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` (`assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertThrows`, etc.).
- Use `assertAll` to group multiple assertions and report all failures together.
- Use `assertTimeout` and `assertTimeoutPreemptively` to test time-sensitive operations.
- Use `@Tag` to categorize tests and run specific groups (e.g., `@Tag("slow")`, `@Tag("integration")`).
- Use `@Disabled` to temporarily skip tests with a clear reason provided.
- Use assumptions (`assumeTrue`, `assumeFalse`) to conditionally run tests based on environment.
- Use `@ExtendWith` to integrate with extensions like Mockito, Spring Test, etc.
- Keep tests independent and avoid test interdependencies that require specific execution order.
- Mock external dependencies using Mockito or other mocking frameworks.
- Write tests that are fast, reliable, and provide clear failure messages.

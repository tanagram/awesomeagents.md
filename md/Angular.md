# Angular Best Practices

- Define data structures with interfaces for type safety.
- Avoid `any` type, utilize the type system fully.
- Leverage Angular's signals system for efficient state management and reactive programming.
- Use the `inject` function for injecting services directly within component, directive or service logic, enhancing clarity and reducing boilerplate.
- Use file naming conventions: `*.component.ts` for Components, `*.service.ts` for Services, `*.module.ts` for Modules, `*.directive.ts` for Directives, `*.pipe.ts` for Pipes, `*.spec.ts` for Tests.
- Use kebab-case for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-form`) and PascalCase for component files.
- Use single quotes for string literals.
- Use template strings for string interpolation.
- Use `const` for immutable variables.
- Use async pipe for observables in templates.
- Implement lazy loading for feature modules.
- Ensure accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA labels.
- Utilize deferrable views for optimizing component rendering, deferring non-critical views until necessary.
- Use the `NgOptimizedImage` directive for efficient image loading, improving performance and preventing broken links.
- Use proper error handling in services and components.
- Implement Angular form validation or custom validators.
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation; use Angular's templating system.
- Prevent XSS with Angular's sanitization; avoid using innerHTML.
- Sanitize dynamic content with built-in tools.
- Use Angular's DI system for service injection.
